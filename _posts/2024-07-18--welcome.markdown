Hi, my name is Faiçal, welcome to my blog **Modern Shokunin**. 

I come from a small city in France between Lyon and Geneva. I have studied Computer engineering in Lyon, and graduated in 2006. I am currently attending a distant master program in Physics. As far as I can remember, I have always been passionate about the Japanese culture, especially its food. I had the chance to work in Tokyo and Kobe in 2013/2014. Currently, I have been living in Berlin since 2016, working for a science startup specialised in ML in Quantum computing.

**Shokunin** means in Japanese **craftsman** and this blog is my learning journey through both traditional and modern craftsmanship

**Traditional**
During the first covid lockdown, I have started to discover traditional methods of preserving food and at the same time enhancing its flavour. Starting with the classic sourdough, I have evolved to make cheese and to finally land in the wonderful world of Japanese fermentation.


**Modern**
ML/AI techniques are getting more and more important in science. My professional goal is to bring together quantum physics and ML methods. I would use techniques from software engineering, and especially ML/DevOps tools to bring them together.
