During the day, I am a DevOps engineer, mostly centered Kubernetes and AWS ecosystems. I apply my skills into helping quantum physicists to provision, deploy and run reliable and scalable software. Here, I will share the interesting techniques and technologies used in DevOps. 

Also because I am also exploring AI/ML, I will also  give an extra focus on tools and methods to create scalable and reliable ML pipelines.
