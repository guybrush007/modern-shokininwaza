This year I have started my MSc in Physics at the French university of *Sorbonne universite*. It is a distant learning program that I follow part time. In the second semester, we had to choose a personal bibliography or numerical physics project. I have chosen as a numerical project to implement various methods of quantum state tomography.

The project goal is to be able to solve a simple physics problem and to be able to explain it to fellow students. Since I work in a company making software for quantum computing, I wanted to get familiar to some tools used by my physicists colleagues.

**Quantum state tomography:** Quantum state tomography is a set of methods to reconstruct the density matrix of a quantum state using several correctly chosen measurements.[1]

**QuTiP:** QuTiP is a python package simulating quantum dynamics. Since, it was a short project, I wouldn't have time to perform quantum state tomography on real quantum computers. I have decided to use QuTiP to simulate pure and mixed states. [2]
