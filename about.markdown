Hello, my name is Faiçal (he/him). I'm French, currently living in Berlin, Germany. I have been a software developer for almost 20 years and passionate about Japanese culture for almost all my life. I am also a proud member of the LGBTQ community &#127752;.

Currently, I work as a DevOps engineer in a science startup that harnesses the power of machine learning to solve quantum computers problems. I am also a (poorly performing) distant MSc student at Sorbonne Universite, Paris,  where I try to get an academic education in Physics 

Shokunin - 職人 means in Japanese: craftsman. This blog is just a journal of my exploration in different styles of craftsmanship: 
- the modern ones with ML/AI, ML/DevOps. and quantum physics
- the traditional ones mostly about fermentation techniques, especially Japanese fermentation techniques.
