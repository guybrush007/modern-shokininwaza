Fermentation has been an eye opener for me during the first covid lockdown. I have rediscovered certain food and discovered some amazing new taste, jut by revisiting methods of food preservation. 

My journey right now lays in Japanese fermentation, notably any koji-based fermentation (sake, miso, soy sauce) and Japanese tsukemono pickles. I am also interested in wine and cheese making.

I want to share products, techniques and recipe to discover a new horizon of tastes.
