Hi, 

my name is Fai√ßal, welcome to my blog. I come from a small city in France between Lyon and Geneva. I have studied Computer engineering in Lyon, and graduated in 2006. I am currently attending a master program in Physics. As far as I can remember, I have been passionate about Japanese culture, especially its food. I had the chance to work in Tokyo and Kobe in 2013/2014. Currently, I have been living in Berlin since 2016, working for a science startup specialised in ML in Quantum computing.

**Shokunin** means in Japanese **craftsmanship** and this blog is my learning journey through both traditional and modern craftsmanship

**Traditional**
```
During the first covid lockdown, I have started to discover traditional methods of preserving food and to make it taste better. Starting with the classic sourdough, I have evolved to make cheese to finally land in the wonderful world of Japanese fermentation.

**Modern**
```
ML/AI techniques are more and more important in science. My goal is to bring together quantum physics and ML methods. I would use techniques from software engineering, and especially ML/DevOps tools to bring them together.
